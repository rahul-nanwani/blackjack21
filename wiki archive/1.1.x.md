### Attributes:  

- **players**: A tuple of Player objects
- **dealer**: Dealer object
- **deck**: A list of Card objects in the deck


## PlayerBase  

This object will be created from the method split() from the Player object.  

### Attributes:  

- **name**: Player name string  
- **hand**: A list of Card objects in the player's hand  
- **total**: Sum of the card values in the hand  
- **bet**: Bet placed by the player  
- **bust**: A bool if the player's hand total is more than 21  
- **stand**: A bool if the player has called for no further dealing of cards for the current round  
- **result**: Check the key for this below  
```txt
-2: Player busts
-1: Player has less than the dealer
0: Player has the same total as the dealer and both are not bust
1: Player has 21 (aka. blackjack)
2: Player has greater total than the dealer
3: The dealer is bust
None: player or dealer has not finished playing their hand yet
```

### Methods:  

- **play_hit()**: This will deal an extra card to the player, returns the Card object for the card dealt  
- **play_stand()**: This will stop further dealing of any cards to the player for the current round, returns a bool  


## Player

- **bet**: Bet placed by the player  
- **bust**: A bool if the player's hand total is more than 21  
- **stand**: A bool if the player has called for no further dealing of cards for the current round

- **result**: Check the key for this below  
```txt
-2: Player busts
-1: Player has less than the dealer
0: Player has the same total as the dealer and both are not bust

### Methods:  

- **play_hit()**: This will deal an extra card to the player, returns the Card object for the card dealt  
- **play_stand()**: This will stop further dealing of any cards to the player for the current round, returns a bool  
- **can_double_down()**: Returns a bool if the player can play double down  
- **can_split()**: Returns a bool if the player can play split  
- **play_double_down()**: Double the bet in exchange for just one hit, returns the Card object for the card dealt  
- **play_split()**: The pair will split into two hands, keeping the bet the same on both hands. If the player bets 100 initially, so after playing split the player will have placed 100 on the first hand, and 100 more on the second hand. Returns the PlayerBase object
